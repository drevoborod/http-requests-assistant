+ Add timestamps to log.
+ Make a decision: should we declare parameter type as optional or mandatory? - Decision: type remains optional.
+ Make substitution of values recursive instead of converting to string and back.
- Display json-like type values (true, null) in choices dropdowns and text areas.
- Fix all cases in substitutions
    - check: "None" instead of null even if type "null" is set.
- Write tests of substitution functions (in "core" module: _prepare_section? Or even end-to-end: from config to request?).
- ? Support choices of different types (probably not needed)
